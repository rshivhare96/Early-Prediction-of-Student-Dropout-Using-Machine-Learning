# Student Dropout Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict **student dropout and academic success** using demographic, socioeconomic, and academic data. By leveraging **machine learning models**, we aim to identify patterns that can help educational institutions intervene early and improve student retention rates.

## Data
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on **4,424 students** across various attributes such as:  
- **Demographic data** (gender, age, nationality)  
- **Socioeconomic indicators** (employment status, income level)  
- **Academic performance** (grades, qualifications, previous education)   

## Notebooks & Code
The project is implemented in both **Python**. The following scripts and notebooks are available:  

### Python Implementation  
- `student_predictions.ipynb` → **Interactive Jupyter Notebook** including **EDA, data preprocessing, machine learning models, and deep learning models**.  
- `student_predictions.py` → Complete **Python script** implementing the full pipeline.  
  

## Machine Learning
The following models have been implemented and evaluated:  

### Machine Learning Models  
- ✅ Logistic Regression  
- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- ✅ Decision Tree  
- ✅ **Random Forest (Primary Model)**  
- ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
 

## Usage
To **reproduce the analysis and modeling pipeline**, run the Python notebook end-to-end.
